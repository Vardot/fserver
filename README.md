Feature Server
=======

Feature server for Drupal 7 is built using several "Features" from contributed modules including Services, Panels/Page Manager, Views and others. It is built this way to showcase the power of Features and what is possible by simply exporting configuration from a Drupal site.

We believe Feature Server is an import part of the Drupal ecosystem as it allows configured components to be shared.
